## Hello whoever is here 

To run the code , run the simple command
`python parser.py`

There are somethings you would have to know :

    + __small.grammar__ contains the grammar. It has to be in CNF for now.
    + __example.text__ contains the line to be parsed
    + __parse_tree.png__ will print a picture of the parse tree.
    + A pretty formatted version of the print will appear on terminal.
    
    
Best of luck!
